# k-means-clustering
In this project, I used a basic Machine Learning algorithm named "K-Means" to cluster customer data.

The dataset is downloaded from this [source](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/352/online+retail). You can also find same data [here](https://github.com/prab-hub/k-means-clustering/blob/main/Mall_Customers.csv)

The algorithm segmented our customers into 6 clusters based on various factors like gender, earning capacity, and spending score. [They can be seen here.](https://github.com/prab-hub/k-means-clustering/blob/main/clustered_mall_customers.csv)

Clusters are visualized here:
