# k-means-clustering
In this peoject we have used basic Machine Learning algorithm named "K-Means" to cluster to customer data.

Dataset is downloaded from this [source](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/352/online+retail). You can also find same data [here](https://github.com/prab-hub/k-means-clustering/blob/main/Mall_Customers.csv)

Algorithm segmented our customers into 6 clusters. [They can be seen here.](https://github.com/prab-hub/k-means-clustering/blob/main/clustered_mall_customers.csv)

Clustered are visualized here:
